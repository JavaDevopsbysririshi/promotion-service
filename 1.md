In Git Flow, a feature branch is used to develop new features for upcoming releases. The idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the main branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. 
To use a feature branch, you start a feature branch off the develop branch. When the feature is completed and properly reviewed, you merge your changes back into the develop branch. 
To create a new branch, you can use the git branch command. Once created, you can use git checkout new_branch to switch to that branch
