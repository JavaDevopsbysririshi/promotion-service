Certainly! Let's break down the detailed flow from GCP to infrastructure building using GitHub Actions, self-hosted runners, and Terraform scripts:

Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

This is your cloud infrastructure provider. You will create and manage resources like virtual machines (VMs), databases, and other services in GCP.
GCP VM:

You have a virtual machine (VM) hosted on Google Cloud Platform where you intend to run your self-hosted GitHub Actions runner.
Self-Hosted Runner + Script + GitHub Runner Unique Token:

You set up a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on the GCP VM.
To authenticate and connect this runner to GitHub, you generate a unique token (registration token) from your GitHub repository settings. This token is used to authenticate the runner during the registration process.
Runner Container:

You may use a containerization technology like Docker to encapsulate the runner setup and dependencies. This container will run the self-hosted GitHub Actions runner.
GitHub Self-Hosted Runner:

The self-hosted runner is responsible for executing GitHub Actions workflows on your GCP VM.
It connects to GitHub using the unique token, listens for workflow events, and runs jobs specified in your GitHub Actions workflows.
GitHub Action YAML File:

In your GitHub repository, you define GitHub Actions workflows using YAML files (e.g., .github/workflows/main.yml).
These workflows define the steps and jobs to execute whenever specific events occur, such as code pushes or pull requests.
Commit Message Required Format:

You may enforce a specific commit message format in your repository, ensuring consistency and clarity in your version control history. For example, you might require commit messages to include a prefix like [feature], [bugfix], or [ci].
Shell Script:

Within your GitHub Actions workflow, you can include shell scripts (e.g., bash scripts) to perform various tasks.
These scripts can be used for build, test, deployment, or any other automation steps required for your project.
Terraform Script:

If your project involves infrastructure provisioning and management, you may have Terraform scripts that define your infrastructure as code (IAC).
These scripts declare the desired state of your infrastructure resources (e.g., VMs, networks, databases) and can be used to create or update them in GCP.
Infrastructure Building:

GitHub Actions workflows can trigger Terraform scripts to create or update infrastructure in your GCP account.
This step automates the provisioning of cloud resources according to your Terraform configurations.
Any necessary configuration parameters or secrets can be passed securely to Terraform using GitHub Secrets or environment variables.
In summary, this flow describes how you use GitHub Actions, self-hosted runners, and Terraform to automate the deployment and management of resources on Google Cloud Platform. GitHub Actions workflows are used to define the automation steps, and self-hosted runners execute these workflows on a GCP VM, interacting with GCP resources and running scripts as needed to achieve your project's goals.
